## Ideas:
- Use http://www.figlet.org/examples.html to print fancy ASCII art logo
- random start point from multiple startplaces
  have a different list in game data for them
- save game
- text refactor
  - move texts to a different file (help, random texts, etc.)
  - multiple text and choose randomly
    e.g. player wants to go to a non-existent place: (What?) (I'm afraid that is not possible!)
  - use text from favorite games

## Favorite Texts
### Commandos
I'm afraid that is not possible!  
### Morrowind
Welcome Outlander!  
### Star Craft
